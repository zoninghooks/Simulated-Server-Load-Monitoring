## Simulated Server Load Monitoring

A simple simulated server load monitor program. 

generator.py generates a .json file that lists 10 servers, and assigns them a random integer between 0 and 100. 

If the integer is over 50, then it will show that it is overutilised. 

However, if the integer is below 50 it will show that it is underutilised.
